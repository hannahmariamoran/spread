                Industry-standard tools - Apple computers, Adobe software - have created astonishing new possibilities for graphic designers. But is this liberation, or a new kind 
                of imprisonment?

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <body>
                Muriel Cooper spent much of her career working at the forefront of computer-aided design as founder of the Visible Language Workshop at MIT, and was concerned throughout with 'the significance of participatory and non-authoritarian communication forms'. In 1989, she concluded the essay 'Computers and Design' with a cautionary note, writing that the 'changes that will be effected by computers and the information revolution are pervasive. Every aspect of every profession and every life will be changed by it. Little of that change to date has been in the hands of the design professions, the educators, or the citizenry. It is imperative that we […] educate ourselves and participate in the direction of this polymorphous medium.''

            <body>
                If there was already concern that designers would be excluded from the development of their new digital tools at that early stage in their adoption, what should be said about the way the field of graphic design is largely governed by Apple and Adobe, who wield vast power over the working practices of designers?

            <body>
                Though Apple and Adobe produce different kinds of products (computers and software respectively) considered together, they exert a kind of duopoly over the practice of graphic design. As 'industry standard' tools, Apple computers and Adobe software are today synonymous with both the production of graphic design and the identity of the graphic designer. Students are trained through them in school; studios and freelancers depend on them for their day-to-day business; and they act as de facto sponsors at design conferences around the world through their ubiquitous presence on stage (and dispersed among audiences).

                But while the word duopoly expresses an economic reality, 'hegemony' is an equally appropriate term to consider, to comprehensively understand what the dominance of both corporations means. As cultural critic Raymond Williams explained it, hegemony exists when our ways of seeing the world ;are not just intellectual but political facts'; when a particular way of seeing the world depends 'not only on its expression of interests of the ruling class but also on its acceptance as “normal reality” or “common sense” by those in practice subordinated to it'.

            <h2>Locked Out From Ownership</h2>
            <body>
                Apple and Adobe are the ruling classes of graphic design, and at whatever point their products became the self-evident choice of tool for the industry, they penetrated the consciousness of its designers to become part of the 'normal reality' of their professional lives. Within mainstream graphic design practice there are few popular alternatives, though the reasons behind the saturating usage of each differ - in the case of Apple, their status as the 'designer's choice' has remained little questioned (despite an increased focus on luxury commodity production), while Adobe have long since superseded or bought out most rival software producers to become the universal standard for the production of graphic design.

                Most powerfully, the graphic designer's identity has become brand-specific, enmeshed as it is with the identity of these products.
                
                Sociologist Celia Lury has described the way in which many contemporary corporations seek to establish themselves as a 'platform for action' by creating scenarios where consumers completely equate specific forms of activity with their brands. Apple and Adobe have both succeeded in these aims; most designers cannot imagine practising without using their products.
                
                Drawing on Lury's ideas, social scientist Adam Arvidsson has argued that contemporary brands work 'to “program” the freedom of consumers to evolve in particular directions' and 'the task of brand management is to create a number of resistances that make it difficult or unlikely for consumers to experience their freedom, or indeed their goals, in ways different from those prescribed ...' Adobe's initially controversial decision in 2013 to discontinue their Creative Suite software in favour of the Creative Cloud subscription service provided a clear case of this 'programming' strategy in action. Users now pay a rolling licence-fee and are locked out from ownership of the primary tools of their trade, forced perennially to repurchase access to them - each time reaffirming their position as subordinate consumer first, designer second.

            </blockquote>
            <body>
                This locking-out takes place not only at the level of ownership, but also increasingly at the level of knowledge about the tools being employed. How many designers (this author included) understand anything about the technology that supports the machines and software that they use on a daily basis? The philosopher Bruno Latour describes 'the way scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success' as blackboxing - 'When a machine runs efficiently … one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become.'This point takes on an acute resonance when considered in relation to the profession of graphic design, where knowledge of the mechanics of production have, since early Modernism at least, been held as a prerequisite for good practice.
